Twisting, wretched in the gut and blank in the head is The First. The primordial ailment from which all that have and will come have sought to remedy. Endless by nature of logic, endless by nothing and an everything of saturation too great to pierce. The Saturation: impenetrable by any hands, it is touched only by greater forces.

Yenra, manifest of The First and sufferer of its plight, reached with arms uncountable to cradle the taunting Saturation. In the oldest tongue: "But why, must this fountain of all — parade before me and my unending abyss?"

Though it be everything and anything — all times: each past, present, and future; The Saturation is but a marble in the sea of Yenra's plight, stretched forever into forever and baring not one aspect more, not one stimulus or spark was there to tear at the unyielding First.

"Then I shall be as you, lesser than the void yet greatest in mind!"

From splayed unchanging, the thousand tendrils in a dozen cardinals, Yenra dwindled, into a minor thing, a second — yet dull — marble in the sea unbearable. Though equal in insignificance, Yenra would not shine like The Saturation, and thus The Second was born.

Fiery was its draw. A sudden celestial will to consume, overcome, and vindicate. Retribution for thyself. To challenge the everything. To snap the indifferent dazzlement of The Saturation and crush it between insatiable teeth.

Yet The Second, as preluded by The First, was itself only a prelude. The little marble Yenra, drifting in the sea eternal, under the ever-imposing glow of The Saturation, began to simmer in greater forces. So shimmer, did Yenra. A cold, maleficent radiance. Balanced precariously on the swirling mind of the Child of The First.

It could not be bared any longer. Yenra — assumed original form; wild and expansive, as large as nothingness itself — ensnared it's bright sister marble, wrapping around its glistening light and cloaking it from the great expanse. Placing — in the spirit of the now Third: true flame, an active and projected torment — a great pressure upon all of its sides. It is touched only by greater forces, and greater forces — The Third — does Yenra possess.

The Saturation, ever brilliant and unbreakable, fought back against the will of The Third, yet all-ness is forever weakened by finitude, and nothingness ever emboldened by infinity, and so the marble began to crack.

Yenra, as kindling of The Third, reached in with burning tendrils to steal The Saturation, and finally fill the void that had lived empty for three Aeterna already. A minute pocket was grasped — holding the matter of a great many Celestia — and torn from the broken marble, which shattered into an inky dust, and the all-ness inside was set free amongst the void.

Yenra: Child of The First, Bearer of The Second, and Kindling of The Third, is too shattered across the expanse. Eviscerated in body, yet only stretched in mind. And from the grasped pocket, that ethereal net of the original Saturation, were born four children: the Audena.
