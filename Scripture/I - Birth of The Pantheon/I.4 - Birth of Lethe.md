So did Yanel tumble through the cosmos, the imprint of her being stretching across space and forever torn into the fabric of time. Ages passed in her absence, and this rift in the stars grew ever wider.

And so too did a great rift grow within the Audena — their souls aching with the absence of their sibling, and from this ache did grow the immutable template of The Heart, such is the aspect that would be passed on to all souls that would follow.

Develop, did The Heart, in a state of great turmoil, and the Audena underwent a change. No longer did their affairs span the eons, nor did the currents of their minds continue to pervade the passing Aeterna; now it was mere years (as they would come to be known), or even months or weeks would be all that the turbulent minds of the Audena needed to shift. Such was the powers of The Heart.

Yet within this turmoil came an even greater prowess. The Audena, reeled by distance of Yanel, began to *hope*. They *hoped* for her return. They *hoped* for her safety. They *hoped* with all the strengths of their beings, that they would again see the sibling Yanel.

And Yanel, whom had hurtled through the cosmos for untold passings, whose mind had withered and hazed under the ailment of The First, would finally see a winding path — a swirling tunnel piercing through the splayed matter of the old Saturation that wrapped around her and gave her the aspect of The Heart.

It would not be long then (in the Audenan timespans), before Yanel was pulled free of the cosmos and once more felt the embrace of her kin. And with Yanel came a new being. Lethe, first of the Linye, whom bowed before the Audena and spoke her first words: "O great Audena, ---"
