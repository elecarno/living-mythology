Twisting, wretched in the gut and blank in the head is The First. The primordial experience from which all that have and will come have sought to remedy. Endless by nature of logic, endless by nothing and an everything of saturation too great to pierce. The Saturation: impenetrable by any hands, it is touched only by greater forces.

Yenra, manifest of The First and sufferer of its plight, reached with arms uncountable to cradle the taunting Saturation. In the oldest tongue: "But why, must this fountain of all — parade before me and my unending abyss."

Though it be everything and anything — all times: each past, present, and future; The Saturation is but a marble in the sea of Yenra's plight, stretched forever into forever and baring not one aspect more, not one stimulus or spark was there to tear at the unyielding First.

"Then I shall be as you, lesser than the void yet greatest in mind!"

From splayed unchanging, the thousand tendrils in a dozen cardinals, Yenra dwindled. Into a minor thing, a second — yet dull — marble in the sea unbearable. Though equal in insignificance, Yenra would not shine like the Saturation, and thus The Second was born.

Fiery was its draw. A sudden celestial will to consume, overcome, and vindicate. Retribution for thyself. To challenge the everything. To snap the indifferent dazzlement of The Saturation and crush it between insatiable teeth.
